# BehavioralCloning
Implementation of BCO and BCO on the mountain car environment from OpenAI gym

### :key: Run the Project
* Install the dependencies by creating and activating the environment_basic.yml
* To run either of the files, it is simply python "filename".py
* You will first be required to give a demonstration to train the agent (The goal is to get out of the valley the car starts in)
* By default, the number of demos is 1, but the number of demos can be manually set by running "python mountain_car_bc.py --num_demos 5" for 5 demos for example

  
### :books: Libraries Used
* Pytorch, Numpy, Gym (from OpenAI), Pygame

### :star: Output
* The average, minimum and maximum of the 6 tests performed by the agent in the mountaincar environment
